MonologBundle
=============

The `MonologBundle` provides integration of the [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)
library into the Symfony2 framework.

As of v2.4.0 of the bundle, the release cycle is de-synchronized from the framework's.
It means you can just require `"symfony/monolog-bundle": "~2.4"` in your composer.json
and Composer will automatically pick the latest version of the bundle that works with
your current version of Symfony. The minimum version of Symfony2 for this workflow
is 2.3.0.

More information in the official [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/logging/index.html).
